VBT ANALYSIS:

Volume Based Trading Analysis:


WHAT IT IS ?
My approach is simple and it looks on two factors ‘price’ and ‘volume’ combined with News

- Volume – tells you whether there are buyers or sellers for this stock in the market.
- Price  – tells you which direction the stock is moving.
- News   - tells you what really caused the movement.

So, the strategy here is, if there is a volume breakout on a stock with increase in price and there are some good news about the stock(stock is buzzing), it gives indication that people started showing interest in the stock. Hence, the possibility of the uptreand in the stock is high



HOW IT WORKS ?
- I keep a script which try to get top 15 stocks(on a particular)[only A grade stocks, since they are reliable] and try to get their volume pattern. If there is a real breakout in the volume(10 times of average volume/ Close to previous highest volume), The script searches for news about the stock in the market. 

- The script then tries to compose a list(with stock details, volume chart and News) and send it as an e-mail.
- I will cron this script so that, the script automatically fetches result for me at 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM each day.
- From the e-mail result, you could analyse, which stock you could go
